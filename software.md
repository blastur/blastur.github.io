Although I work as software engineer, I do occasional recreational programming
aswell. You can find most of my stuff on my [Github account](https://github.com/blastur/).

- [glesys-dnshook](https://github.com/blastur/glesys-dnshook). A hook script for
the Let's Encrypt ACME client "dehydrated" that allows you to use
[GleSYS](https://glesys.com) DNS records to respond to dns-01 challenges. In
short, it brings Let's Encrypt SSL management to GleSYS customers.

- [pypowermate](https://github.com/blastur/pypowermate). A Python interface
to the Griffin USB PowerMate "knob" device.

- [yubikey](https://github.com/blastur/yubikey). A PHP class for decoding
Yubikey One-Time-Passwords (OTPs).

- [magboot](https://github.com/blastur/magboot). A bootloader for the AVR
ATmega168 and ATmega328 processors. It can be used to flash these processors
over a serial connection.

- [PEEX](https://github.com/blastur/PEEX). Python wEbpage EXchanger (PEEX) is a
non-interactive FTP-client for updating webpages.

- [HashAuth](https://github.com/blastur/hashauth). Hashauth is a webpage with
javascripts that helps you manage your passwords without a traditional password
database.

- [magnag](https://github.com/blastur/magnag). A prank-application designed to
run on a [Teensy](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/) and does random keypresses by
emulating a USB-keyboard. The keypresses become more aggresive and annoying over
time (several weeks).
