You're looking at the new and improved mag32.net, based on Jekyll and hosted by
Github pages. I decided to ditch my old website based on an implementation of
the ["Website META Language" (WML)](https://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/website-meta-language/)
in favor of Jekyll because WML is no longer easily accessible on the distros I
use. It was just a pain to update the webpages, which resulted in me not doing
it.

Hope you enjoy it! It's based on the "Minima" Jekyll theme.
